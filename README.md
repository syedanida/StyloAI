## StyloAI – LLM-Powered Fashion Recommendation System

StyloAI is an enhanced fashion recommendation system with virtual try-on capabilities powered by Kling AI. The system integrates a large language model (LLM) to enable natural language-based outfit recommendations, intelligent filtering, and personalized fashion styling. Users can input casual queries like 'Suggest something for a winter date night' and receive curated suggestions, visually try them on, and give feedback to improve results.

Core Features to be Implemented

1.⁠ ⁠LLM-Powered Fashion Assistant
* ⁠Natural language interface for personalized clothing suggestions.
* LLM extracts attributes (e.g., season, style, fabric) and maps them to catalog filters.

2.⁠ ⁠Virtual Try-On Using Kling AI
* Integration with Kling AI to display how selected outfits look on the user.
* ⁠Users upload an image or avatar for the try-on.

3.⁠ ⁠Feedback-Based Refinement (LLM Feedback Loop)
* ⁠Users provide feedback in natural language post try-on (e.g., “Too colorful”).
* ⁠LLM interprets the feedback and refines the recommendations accordingly.

4.⁠ ⁠Prompt Engineering for Kling Try-On
* Dynamically generate enhanced prompts to Kling AI for more realistic visuals, controlling lighting, pose, and style.
